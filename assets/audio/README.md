## Implementation Notes

1. All sounds should be high-quality, stereo audio files (48kHz, 16-bit minimum)
2. Binaural beats should be seamlessly loopable
3. Interaction sounds should have quick attack and short decay
4. Ambient sounds should have smooth fade-in/fade-out capabilities
5. All sounds should work harmoniously together when layered

## User Control

The app provides full control over the sound experience:
- Master volume control
- Individual volume controls for different sound categories
- Option to disable binaural beats
- Option to disable all sounds
- Separate controls for ambient and interaction sounds
